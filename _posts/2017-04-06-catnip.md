description: Static annotations for Kittens for people who don't like to write semiautomatic derivations into companion objects themselves
---

If you love [Kittens](https://github.com/typelevel/kittens) but you find automatic generation kind of heavy,
and ideally you would like to have something that does semiauto derivation and puts it into companion object
-- Catnip is here to support you with `@Semi` macro annotation.

You can find details at [Catnip's documentation](https://scalalandio.github.io/catnip/).
