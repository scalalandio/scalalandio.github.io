Chimney is a library transforming an instance of one case class to another, when fields in both classes are very similar. If you have a case of:

* event migration
* distinction between API entities and internal entities (that are similar but not exaclty the same)
* rewrite between Java Beans into case classes and vice versa
* basically a lot of classes which are very similar except of few fields which were added/removed/renamed/changed that needs to be converted to-and-from
* or when you want to patch some fields in one object using another object without a lot of manual work

Take a look at [Chimney's documentation](https://scalalandio.github.io/chimney/).
