description: Scala library for repositories generating Doobie queries from higher-kinded data
---

Overly-Complicated Database Query takes a case class defined by you and turns it into:

* config format for defining column-name-to-case-class-field mapping (with sane defaults)
* creation object allowing you to pass only certain fields to `INSERT` while the others will use `DEFAULT`s
* entity object fetched from database
* update object that let you update only certain fields without writing whole object at once filters for select, update and delete queries

Basically, it creates a repository basing on your (higher-kinded) case class.

Additionally, repositories can be joined together to fetch tuples of objects.

All returned results are [Doobie](https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/) queries.

You can find details at [OCDQuery's documentation](https://scalalandio.github.io/ocdquery/).
