description: One enum type class to rule them all.

In Scala you might meet many different implementations of enums:

 * build-in `scala.Enumeration`,
 * sum-type based sealed hierarchies,
 * `enumeratum` as the previous one on steroids,
 * Java's `enum` type which use static methods and has no companion object.

You are in control of what implementation *you* pick, but you have no control over
what *other people* use. So if you had to use APIs using many different
implementations how would you handle common code?

With a type class.

You can find details at [Enumz's documentation](https://scalalandio.github.io/enumz/).
